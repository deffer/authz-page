# OAuth2 Authorization Server 

https://wiki.auckland.ac.nz/display/APPLCTN/OAuth+Authorisation+Server

Implements a user-facing Authorization Page to support a step in OAuth2 `Implicit` and `Authorization Code` flows. 
Integrates with Kong, where Kong is used to manage codes/tokens and token-based access to APIs.
The main purpose of Authorization Page is to authenticate the end user (through SSO configured on webroute) 
and relay user's consent to Kong. Kong will provision a code/token which is then returned to the client.

## Important

 * This version is intended to work with Kong versions 0.9.6 - 0.9.9, 0.10.x
 * Make sure to put java.conf (from `deploy` folder) to the `/etc/authserver` after deployment

## Overview  

Exposes two endpoints:

 * authorize endpoint `/oauth2/authorize` which returns code or token (based on request type), part of [OAuth2 spec](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-3.1)
 * user profile endpoint `/self` - a user-facing page to allow self-service token revocation at `/self/token/{token}`
 * a generic page at `/` to help users who got lost

On top of OAuth2 protocol, it includes some customizations specific to University:

 * *trusted* consumers - for web application which are part of University web experience, the end user will not be asked to approve the access
 * *dynamic* consumers - consumers with varying callback, can be configured for any consumer and typically used on API Explorers. These consumers 
 can provide an alternative `callback` uri on the call to `/oauth2/authorize` and this should be allowed as long as it is on the same domain as registered in Kong
 * *remember my decision* - allowing user to _remember_ their decision (to approve) for 1 month and don't ask them again.
 

## Building manually

    mvn package

Releasing manually

    mvn release:prepare
    mvn release:perform

## Running manually

Configure properties (following example in `src/main/resources/application.properties`) and place it in a working folder. Run

    nohup java -jar authz-page-xx.jar >as.out 2>&1 &

## For developers

Start your server from Intellij IDEA as maven springboot plugin with the goal `springboot:run`

You can view the application by navigating to
http://localhost:8090/identity/oauth2/authorize?client_id=uoa-explorer-client&response_type=token

Or set the `as.development=true`, navigate to http://localhost:8090/ and find test links at the bottom of the page 

You can change the port in application.properties.

The properties files will be looked up in:

 * application.properties in classpath
 * application.properties in the current folder
 * $HOME/.webdev/as.properties
 * $HOMEPATH/.webdev/as.properties

Please note, application.properties in the classpath take preference 
over as.properties from home folders. When building application,
ensure all properties in application.properties are commented.

Another note. Logging configuration must go into `application.properties`. For some reason if its in the additional properties (`as.properties`) it is ignored.
 


## Deployment

This application is deployed in the same manner as APIs, utilizing `api-installer` and jenkins to [create a service](https://wiki.auckland.ac.nz/display/ITPRO/API+-+Developers+guide#API-Developersguide-Step3-Createservice)
and using java CI/CD pipeline for deployments.

Properties can be found in `/etc/authserver/application.properties`
Deployment jar is in `/usr/share/apis/autherserver`
Logs are in `/var/log/apis/authserver/as.`

To restart the service manually, run

    sudo systemctl restart authserver

To change JVM properties or any other details of jar execution, look in the `/opt/authserver/authserver.initd`

## Building rpm (deprecated)
 
This application can be built into rpm, however it is not recommended. Instructions on how to build it as rpm are below.

Following general instructions on how to package an app as rpm [here](https://wiki.auckland.ac.nz/display/GroupApps/Packaging+app+as+rpm), 
place `authserver.spec` (which can be found in `deploy` folder) into `rpmbuild/SPECS` folder on your build server. Run
 
    rpmbuild -ba -D "version 0.0.8" ./SPECS/authserver.spec
    
This will download the specified version of the jar from Nexus and package it as rpm.

### Installing and running rpm (deprecated)

Without uploading to Uoa-apps-dev repo (because its usually not available), copy onto VM and install using yum
 
    sudo yum localinstall authserver-0.0.8-1.noarch.rpm
    
All further upgrades to Auth Server can be done by simply copying new jar version into `/usr/share/`.
Logs can be found in `/var/log/authserver` and properties in `/etc/authserver/`.

The application is installed as systemd service, to restart

    sudo systemctl restart authserver
